#Create variables
    #website: e.g ```website1 = Facebook```
    #account_name: e.g ```account1 = myaccount@gmail.com```
    #password: e.g ``` password1 = 123456```
    #nd more websites and counts and password
#Print out the question for users to ask, ```"what website's password do you want to see"```

#Print out options for users to choose

    #1. Facebook
    #2. Twitter

#Show the account and password base on what users choose. E.g

#If users want to see facebook, they press 1,
#and you have to print out account1 and password1.
#And so on.
#try making a loop!


MY PRACTICE ANSWER:


website1 = "Facebook"
website2 = "LinkedIn"
website3 = "Twitter"
website4 = "Instagram"
website5 = "GitHub"
account1 = "myaccount@gmail.com"
account2 = "myaccount@yahoo.com"
password1 = "hsk58sha43o"
password2 = "t04naas67"
password3 = "cnks-xliwq3"
password4 = "u3csioxo"
password5 = "dy748cjjhhh"

ctn = True
while ctn:
    print("Oh shoot! Which account's password did you forget? Type a number. 1. Facebook, 2. LinkedIn, 3. Twitter, 4. Instagram, 5. GitHub")

    answer1 = int(input("Type a number >>"))
    if answer1 == 1:
        print("Your account: {}".format(website1))
        question = input("Type u for username and p for password recovery.")
    if answer == "u":
        print(("Your user name: {}".format(account1))
    elif answer1 == 2:
        print("Your account: {}".format(website2))
    elif  answer1 == 3:
        print("Your account: {}". format(website3))
    else:
        print("There is no such account, please try choosing another option from the list")
    wish = input("Do you wish to continue? Y/N")
    if wish.lower() == "Y" or wish.lower()== 'yes':
        ctn = True
    elif wish.lower()== 'no' or wish.lower() == 'n':
        print ("Thank you. Bye bye. Have a nice day.")
    else:
        print("Please specify")
        wish = input("Do you wish to continue? Y/N")
        ctn = False
        break
#To be user friendly, the answer option should include y and Y

#checking this. How to make a loop. Not quite working yet:)
